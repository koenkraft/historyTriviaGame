  <h1> HistoryTriviaGame </h1>
  <p> I previously created a small program that asked the user to input a year from 1 C.E. to the present, and then scrapped wikipedia to give the user a random event that happened that year.
  I mainly made it teach myself how to webscrape and process the resulting information.</p> 
  <p>While writing it, I thought of a way to expand on that concept and this program is the result. 
    Now, the year is randomly generated and hidden from the user, and the user must guess the year based on a given event. Since many very obscure events are pulled from wikipedia are pulled, 
    as long as the user can guess within 100 years. The user also gets the option to continue playing, and gets another event to guess the year of. Additionally the program tracks the users average score from the session and displays it after each question.</p> </main>
